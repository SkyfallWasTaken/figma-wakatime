## How it works

The extension monitors your activity in Figma and sends heartbeats to WakaTime when you're actively designing. It tracks:
- File edits and views
- Time spent on different projects
- Design activity patterns

Your data is securely sent to WakaTime's servers and can be viewed in your WakaTime dashboard.

## Privacy

The extension tracks:
- Project and layer names
- Time spent editing/viewing
- The time of day you made changes
- OS and browser name (e.g. Chrome on Windows)
